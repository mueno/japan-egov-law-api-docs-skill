## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.
- If GitHub private vulnerability reporting is enabled, use that channel first.
- If private reporting is not available, open an issue that requests a private
  contact path without including exploit details.

Maintainers will acknowledge reports and provide remediation status updates.
