# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level
of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and discuss ideas, not people.
- Provide actionable technical feedback.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments.
- Publishing private information without explicit permission.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and
other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

For reports, open a private communication channel with maintainers where
possible. If private reporting is unavailable, open an issue requesting a
private contact path without disclosing sensitive details.
